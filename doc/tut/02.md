# Yamp 1.0.0.5 tutorial 02

[Tutorials](./INDEX.md).

## Introduction
In the previous lesson we looked
at the structure of a parser module,
the basic parser `matchChar`, how to
run our parsers on an input stream
with `parse` and how to write our
own parsers. In this tutorial we
will learn the internals of the
`Parser` data type. So buckle up for
a nice bunch of Monadic code.

## Definition
So lets take a look at `Parser`'s
definition and it's dependence
`Stream` (both of these are in
`Data.Yamp`).
```haskell
type Stream
    = String

newtype Parser a =
    Parser (Stream -> [(a,Stream)])
```
Alright the first definition, of
`Stream`, states that the type
`Stream` is just an alias for the
type `String`. We create this alias
for comprehensive reasons. Next we
actually define `Parser`. `Parser`
is defined as taking the pollymorphic
type `a` and being a `Parser`. The
constrcutor `Parser` takes a function
that takes an initial `Stream` and
returns an `a` paired with the remaining
contents of the `Stream`. So that is it;
a parser is a function of the type:
```haskell
Stream -> (a,Stream)
```
Those of you who are experience with
Haskell will recognise this as being
a State-Transformer.

## Making it a `Monad`
This section requires no knowledge of
what a `Monad` is, so don't worry.
```
Caution: I don't teach you what a `Monad`
         is in general! I only teach you
         about `Monad`s in the context of
         the `Parser` type.
```
Alright lets look at the rest of
`Data.Yamp`.
```haskell
instance Functor Parser where
    --
    -- fmap :: (a -> b) -> Parser a -> Parser b
    --
    fmap f px = Parser (\stream0 ->
        case apply px stream0 of
            []            -> []
            [(x,stream1)] -> [(f x,stream1)])

instance Applicative Parser where
    --
    -- pure :: a -> Parser a
    --
    pure x = Parser (\stream0 ->
        [(x,stream0)])

    --
    -- (<*>) :: Parser (a -> b) -> Parser a -> Parser b
    --
    pf <*> px = Parser (\stream0 ->
        case apply pf stream0 of
            []            -> []
            [(f,stream1)] ->
                case apply px stream1 of
                    []            -> []
                    [(x,stream2)] -> [(f x,stream2)])

instance Monad Parser where
    --
    -- (>>=) :: Parser a -> (a -> Parser b) -> Parser b
    --
    px >>= fp = Parser (\stream0 ->
        case apply px stream0 of
            []            -> []
            [(x,stream1)] -> apply (fp x) stream1)
```
